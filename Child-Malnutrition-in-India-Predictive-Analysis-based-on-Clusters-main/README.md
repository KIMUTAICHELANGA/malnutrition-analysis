K-Modes Clustering and Exploratory Data Analysis
Overview
This project aims to perform K-Modes clustering on a dataset and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the underlying patterns and structures within the data. The K-Modes algorithm is particularly suitable for categorical data, making it an ideal choice for datasets with a mix of categorical and numerical features.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
kmodes
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Place your dataset file in the project directory.

Update the dataset_path variable in the main.py file with the path to your dataset file.

Run the main.py file:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
The script will perform K-Modes clustering and generate visualizations for EDA, including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
